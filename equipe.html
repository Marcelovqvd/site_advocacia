            <h3>Chuck McGill</h3>
            <p>Charles "Chuck" Lindbergh McGill, Jr. was Jimmy McGill's older brother. He is a named partner at one of
              Albuquerque's
              most prestigious law firms, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill, which he co-founded along with Howard Hamlin's father. A
              brilliant man who held himself and others to high ideals, Chuck firmly believed that doing the right thing is the
              only
              true path to success.

              Chuck claimed to suffer from electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), an unusual affliction garnered under mysterious
              circumstances, which made it challenging for him to lead a normal life. However, in reality, it appears that Chuck
              was
              mentally ill rather than physically.

              Throughout the first season, Chuck is seen as a protagonist, up until the penultimate episode, where he is revealed
              as
              an underlying antagonist of Better Call Saul, as most of the obstacles Jimmy faces can be traced back to Chuck.
              Despite this, however - Chuck seemed to genuinely love his brother, but believed his alleged nature makes him unfit
              to
              be a lawyer. In contrast to this presumed affection, Chuck later claimed that he never cared that much about Jimmy
              and
              as such was his true nemesis. He serves as the primary antagonist of Season 1 and one of the two primary antagonists
              of Season 2 and Season 3.

              After suffering a major relapse of his EHS following his failed attempt to get Jimmy disbarred as well as failing to
              sue HHM for breach of contract and destroying his friendship with Howard in the process, Chuck committed suicide by
              setting fire to his house.
